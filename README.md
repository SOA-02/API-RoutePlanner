# Mission FizzBuzz

## 1. Setup Instructions


In your working folder, use `rbenv` to set the version of ruby for this project.

```sh
$ rbenv local #.#.#
# (where #.#.# sgpg --full-generate-key
hould be the your latest installed ruby version)
```

Then,use the `bundle` command at the Unix shell to install all the necessary gems from the `Gemfile` file:

```sh
$ bundle install
# (You only need to run this once; bundle should report success)
```

A `Gemfile.lock` file should appear showing the installed gem versions
