        Analytics using Machine Learning\nInstructor: Galit Shmueli (galit.shmueli@iss.nthu.edu.tw)
        TA: Cindy (Yu-Hsuan) Liu\nWebsite: canvas.instructure.com/courses/9474145\nCourse
        Description\nTerm: Fall 2024\nClass Time: Tuesdays, 14:20-17:20\nClass Location:
        Room 406, TSMC Building\n  Business analytics is the use of data-driven decision
        making. Companies, governments and other organizations now collect and have
        access to large amounts of data about suppliers, clients, employees, citizens,
        transactions, etc. Data mining (now better known as machine learning) and
        predictive analytics provide a powerful toolkit for detecting actionable patterns
        in data and generating predictions. These methods are used in many industries:
        Mobile companies use their customer database to predict customer churn or
        to personalize messages for improving customer service; Financial institutions
        use past loan data to predict defaulting chance for loan applicants; Charities
        use data from a campaign in one location to target the right people in another
        location; Politicians use databases of supporters to segment and best target
        each audience; Movie, music, and eCommerce websites provide recommendations
        based on users’ online behavior.\nMost business analytics applications are
        geared towards benefitting the company, often at the expense of the individual,
        community, and society. The focus of this course is on humane and socially-responsible
        business analytics.\nIn the course we’ll work with real business problems
        and real data. We will examine types of questions that machine learning (data
        mining) can answer and the appropriate machine learning tools for answering
        different questions. The emphasis is on understanding the concepts and logic
        behind a wide set of machine learning techniques and their relation to specific
        business analytics situations. The course is not about mastering the theoretical
        underpinnings of the techniques. The course is focused on a business analytics
        team project that will encapsulate the learnings.\nOnline Component\nThe course
        is offered in a flipped classroom model. Students are expected to watch videos,
        read the textbook and post in an online forum prior to each on-ground session.
        Face-to-face class time will be devoted to discussions, developing the team
        projects, gaining hands-on experience, invited lectures, and other forms of
        interactive learning.\nCourse Objectives\nUpon successful completion of the
        course, you should possess valuable practical analytical skills that will
        equip you with a competitive skill in almost any contemporary workplace. In
        particular, the knowledge acquired in this course will benefit those who plan
        careers in business and strategic consulting.\nThe course will provide participants
        with the following skills and knowledge:\n● Become familiar with the potential
        and dangers of machine learning in today’s data rich-environment\n● Gain experience
        using key machine learning methods: classification, prediction, data reduction
        and exploration\n● Know how to decide when to use which technique\n● Be able
        to implement major machine learning techniques using software\n● Become a
        smart and critical use and consumer of machine learning techniques\n● Gain
        the intellectual capital required to provide responsible business analytics
        services\n● Be conscious of humanistic and societal implications of deploying
        machine learning in organizations\n2\nLearning Goals\nIn addition to the course
        objectives, students should expect to develop the following by the end of
        the course:\n1. Effective Oral Communication - Each student shall be able
        to communicate verbally in an organized, clear, and persuasive manner, and
        be a responsive listener. (Assessment: Project presentations)\n2. Critical
        and Integrative Thinking - Each student shall be able to identify key issues
        in a business setting, develop a perspective that is supported with relevant
        information and integrative thinking, to draw and assess conclusions. (Assessment:
        Individual Assignments, online discussions, ideation proposal, team presentations)\n3.
        Interpersonal Awareness and Working in Teams - Each student shall demonstrate
        an ability to work effectively in a team, exhibiting behavior that reflects
        an understanding of the importance of individual roles and tasks, and the
        ability to manage conflict and compromise, so that team goals are achieved.
