ISS5095: Marketing Strategies
Customer management & multi-channel management
9.00 – 12.00 Thursdays


COURSE DESCRIPTION
Marketing strategies aim to increase both customer and firm value. Examples of customer value are customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, customer engagement, customer experience, and consumer well-being. Examples of firm value are revenues/sales, profits, customer lifetime value (CLV), and Tobin’s q. 
However, the business environment is complicated and dynamic. Thus, developing proper and effective marketing strategies is challenging. Also, decisions on strategies should be based on not only managers’ practical experiences, but empirical evidence (i.e., data analyses). The course will provide insight into the selection of proper and effective marketing strategies and how to collect empirical evidence.
The scope of marketing strategies is extensive, which could not be completely covered in one course. This course will focus on the B2C (business to consumer) market, particularly in customer management and multi-channel management. Customer management aims to understand/connect customers and create value to customers, which hopefully subsequently improves firm value. In addition, while firms nowadays use different channels (e.g., offline and digital) to reach customers, understanding effective multi-channel management is critical to increase firms’ value. In the course, we will cover a bit “empirical evidence” mentioned above. That is, to achieve marketing objectives, we will discuss what data and analytical methods could be considered. 

COURSE GOALS
The goal of the course provides an overall understanding of marketing strategies in customer management and multi-channel management from a theoretical perspective and also an empirical perspective. From a theoretical perspective, the students will be able to apply learned theories/strategies to finding proper marketing solutions to specific marketing challenges/opportunities. From an empirical perspective, the students will be able to indicate what data and/or analytical methods managers should use to examine the effectiveness of marketing strategies. Examining effectiveness relies on good data and correct analytical methods, rather than own imaginations. 

LEARNING MATERIALS
Academic articles in marketing (see the weekly reading list below)
Note: Academic articles are the main learning materials. I might provide additional articles one week before the class, as the publications are renewed every day. 

Kotler, P., & Keller, K. (2012). Marketing Management (14th edition). Pearson Education Limited. 
Note: You could also use the later editions (16th and 15th). The reason of using the 14th edition is that you have a free online access. The textbook aims to provide you a fundamental concept of marketing management. The discussion of the concept is similar among different editions. This is why using different editions does not matter for the course. The course will not cover every bit of this textbook in detail. However, I would encourage you to read through this textbook as self-learning, particularly if you are new to marketing. 
COURSE EVALUATION
Class attendance and engagement in class discussions: 20%
Midterm individual exam (open book): 40%
Final-term group presentation: 40%

Note: Class attendanceTA will note the number of "sick leave", "absence", and "late arrival or early leave (more than 30 minutes)". 
I do not mark down "sick leave", but more than one sick leave would need (medical/ strong) evidence. 
One absence would have 6 points down (100/16 weeks=~6), except some reasons (e.g., attending sport competitions for NTHU) for the absence.
One late or one early would have 3 points down. 
Note: Class engagementTA will note the number of your engagement in classes (e.g., answering/ asking questions). Below is an example of how engagement scores are calculated. The baseline engagement score is 75 for everyone. 0 time: 75
1 – 4 times: 805 – 7 times: 85
8 – 10 times: 90
11 – 13 times: 95> 13 times: 100
Note: Peer evaluation
To fairly assess each member’s participation and involvement in group work, there will be peer evaluation. The result of peer evaluation has the impact on group work’s marks. Peer evaluation is applied to group work, including the in-class group discussions and the final-term group presentations. I will announce the peer evaluation process during the course. 

TARGET STUDENTS
Open to only graduate students. 
Prerequisites
Have knowledge of marketing basics, such as STP, 4Ps, and customer metrics.  
Have knowledge and experience of empirical methods, such as regressions. 
Having the two prerequisites mentioned above is crucial for your own benefits to follow the course. If you lack the two or one of the prerequisites and intend to attend the course, additional learning outside the class is necessary.  COURSE PLANNING

MIDTERM INDIVIDUAL EXAM
The exam will be open book and take three hours. The students will bring their laptop to do the exam. If someone does not have a laptop, please let me know as soon as possible. 
When the exam starts, the students will receive answering sheets in their email box. You will write down the answers in the sheets. When completing the exam, email the sheets back to me by emails. 
In the exam you will read a case and apply what you learned to this case’s marketing challenges/opportunities. The topics include relationship marketing, do marketing during a downturn, CSR, loyalty programs, celebrities/influencers, sponsorships, social media, (digital) WoM, luxury brands, and counterfeits. Answers should be based on evidence/research findings, rather than own imaginations. Because this is an open book exam, I would encourage you to add references to your answers. That is, to well justify your answers, please extensively use knowledges/theories learned from the academic articles. You should use references for the answers, but do not need to write a reference list.


FINAL-TERM GROUP PRESENTATION
Each group will deliver a presentation. The topic should be selected from the topics from week 9, including marketing is not only about profits, multi-channel management, and better understanding of paid, owned, and earned media. Your presentation tasks are as follows.
Select a company. 
Example: Peloton, https://www.onepeloton.com/. 
Look up the company’s activities in customer management (i.e., improving customer wellbeing) and multi-channel management. 
Examples of improving customer wellbeing: https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-living-with-peloton-bike.html; https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/feeling-good-the-future-of-the-1-5-trillion-wellness-market; https://mehtaphysical.com/what-peloton-can-teach-us-about-community-and-customer-success/ 
Marketing is not only about profits: potential nudges used by Peloton
Marketing is not only about profits: motivations for regular exercising
Marketing is not only about profits: customers’ perspective of well-being
Examples of multichannel management: https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/peloton-review-what-to-know-before-you-buy/; https://www.indigo9digital.com/blog/jpelotonmarketingstrategy; https://nogood.io/2022/01/14/peloton-marketing-strategy/ 
Multi-channel management: offline and online sales channels
Product placement in “And Just Like That”
Media: use paid (e.g., paid search engine), owned (e.g., own website/social media channels, product placement), and earned media (e.g., organic search engine)
Note: Do not discuss too many activities mentioned above, as you could not cover all the activities in 30 minutes. Quality is more important than quantity. For example, you could select one activity regarding customer wellbeing and one regarding multichannel management. Describe the two activities in detail, that is, providing some real-life examples. 
Based on what you learned from the course, discuss whether the company has done well in these two activities. Please justify your arguments based on theories (i.e., academic articles or the textbook), rather than “what you think”.
Example: Note, below is a very brief discussion. In the presentation, you need to elaborate the discussion. You will also discuss the other selected activities.
Product placement: Peloton placed its products in a reboot of a successful and an iconic series, Sex and the City, which may backfire. For example, the series may create audience absorption, which may reduce viewers’ attention to Peloton products. 
Briefly discuss what data you need to collect by evaluating these activities’ effectiveness (optional: you do not have to answer this query).
Example: To examine the effectiveness of product placement in “And Just Like That”, there are multiple ways. First, observe the sales before, during, and after the series. An initial insight could tell us if Peloton sales would increase during and after the series, compared to before the series. Second, survey and ask viewers the extent to which they are aware of Peloton after watching the series and their attitude about Peloton. This could have a basic understanding of whether the series improve customers’ preference to Peloton, for example. Third, we could collect data on social media channels regarding “And Just Like That”. For example, examine viewers’ opinions about Peloton. This way could provide more accurate and extensive information of customers’ attitude about Peloton. 
Find opportunities for the company to create customer wellbeing, either topics in healthy choices or a better world. That is, you need to think of nudges. Justify why the nudges could work. I would prefer you to be creative. However, using the nudges learned from the academic articles is also acceptable. 
Example: Retaining beginners (i.e., worse fitness ability) is often challenge, as they are more likely to drop out than advanced bikers (i.e., better fitness ability). Evidence shows that increasing performance and happiness are a key to retain gym-goers, for example. To increase beginners’ performance, Peloton could encourage beginner to attend a class which has advanced bikers. Such a class is called mixed-level. To increase beginners’ happiness, Peloton could encourage beginners to attend a class which has only beginners. Such a class is called same-level. 
The potential theory for the nudge is social comparison theory. Beginners in the mixed-level classes notice that they perform worse than the advanced bikers, which may motivate them to catch up with the advanced bikers and increase performance. On the other hand, beginners in the same-level classes may feel happy, as they are less likely to feel inferior.
Briefly discuss how you will implement the nudges. 
Example: We may work with Peloton to create different classes, including mixed-level and same-level. Before allocating participants to different classes, we examine participants’ fitness level (using a questionnaire when participants start to join Peloton’s loyalty program). Subsequently, to examine if beginners perform better in mixed-level classes and become happier in same-level classes, we could track these participants’ performance and happiness over time (e.g., ten weeks). Tracking performance could use sport watch’s data, including calories burned or heart rates. Finally, after collecting the relevant data, compare whether beginners in mixed-level classes perform better than beginners in same-level classes. Also, compare whether beginners in same-level classes are happier than beginners in mixed-level classes.  
Rules of group presentations
Group presentations are 20-30 minutes. If a presentation takes less than 20 or more than 30 minutes, the presentation will be marked down. Following the presentation, there will be another 15-20 minutes for Q&A. The groups who do not present are required to ask questions. 
Each group member's presentation time has to be (approximately) equal. When a group has four people, given 30 minutes, we expect that each person should present approximately 7.5 minutes. If someone presents far less than 7.5 minutes, this is not acceptable. 
If someone does not present, he/she will not receive the presentation mark.

Assessment criteria in group presentations
